## Question 1:**Explain tools and techniques for activity sequencing.**


## **Tools & Techniques for Activity Sequencing (Sequence Activities)**  

Activity sequencing ensures that project activities are arranged in the correct order based on dependencies. Various tools and techniques help project managers establish logical relationships between tasks. Below are the **four main tools and techniques** used for activity sequencing:

---

## **1. Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)**  
**Definition:**  
The Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) is a graphical technique used to represent the sequence of project activities and their dependencies. It shows how tasks are linked and helps in scheduling.  

**Types of Dependencies in PDM:**  
- **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: A task must finish before the next one starts. *(Most common)*  
  - **Example**: You must finish writing a book before editing can begin.  
- **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Two activities start at the same time but may finish at different times.  
  - **Example**: Painting can start as soon as priming begins.  
- **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Two activities must finish at the same time.  
  - **Example**: Quality inspection finishes when product assembly finishes.  
- **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: A task must start before another one can finish *(Rarely used)*.  
  - **Example**: A new shift of workers must start before the previous shift ends.  

### **Use Case**  
PDM is widely used in **Gantt Charts** and **Critical Path Method (CPM)** to create project schedules.

## **2. Dependency Determination & Integration**  
**Definition:**  
Identifies different types of dependencies between project activities.  

### **Types of Dependencies**  
1. **Mandatory Dependencies (Hard Logic)**  
   - These are required by the nature of the work.  
   - **Example**: You must build a foundation before constructing walls in a building project.  
2. **Discretionary Dependencies (Soft Logic)**  
   - These are based on best practices or project preferences.  
   - **Example**: In software development, the front-end team may wait for back-end development to be fully tested before integrating.  
3. **External Dependencies**  
   - Involves factors outside the project team’s control.  
   - **Example**: A construction project might depend on government permits.  
4. **Internal Dependencies**  
   - Within the control of the project team.  
   - **Example**: The marketing team must create promotional materials before launching an advertising campaign.  

### **Use Case**  
Used in **schedule network diagrams** to categorize dependencies and manage risks.  

---

## **3. Leads and Lags**  
**Definition:**  
Leads and Lags adjust the start or finish time of dependent activities to optimize scheduling.  

### **Lead Time** (Speeds Up Project)  
- **Definition**: A lead allows a dependent activity to start before its predecessor is fully completed.  
- **Example**:  
  - In a website development project, **content writing** can start before **design completion**.  
- **Benefit**: Reduces overall project duration.  

### **Lag Time** (Delays the Next Activity)  
- **Definition**: A lag introduces a waiting time between two dependent activities.  
- **Example**:  
  - After pouring concrete, **a 3-day lag** is required for curing before painting begins.  
- **Benefit**: Ensures dependencies are met without premature execution.

## **Float (Slack) in Activity-on-Node (AON) Method**  

### **What is Float (Slack) in Project Scheduling?**  
Float, also known as **slack**, is the amount of time an activity can be delayed **without delaying the project’s overall completion** or affecting dependent tasks. It is essential in **Critical Path Method (CPM)** and is used to identify **flexibility in the schedule**.

### **Types of Float in Activity-on-Node (AON) Method**
There are **four types of float** in project scheduling:

1. **Total Float (TF)**  
2. **Free Float (FF)**  
3. **Independent Float (IF)**  
4. **Interfering Float (IntF)**  

Each type of float has its specific formula and purpose in schedule management.

---

## **1. Total Float (TF)**
### **Definition:**  
Total Float is the amount of time an activity can be delayed **without delaying the project’s end date**.

### **Formula for Total Float:**  
\[
TF = LS - ES  \quad \text{or} \quad TF = LF - EF
\]

**Where:**  
- **LS (Late Start)** = The latest time an activity can start without delaying the project.  
- **ES (Early Start)** = The earliest time an activity can start.  
- **LF (Late Finish)** = The latest time an activity can finish without delaying the project.  
- **EF (Early Finish)** = The earliest time an activity can finish.  

### **Key Points:**
- **Critical Path activities always have a TF of 0** (i.e., no flexibility).
- If **TF > 0**, the task has flexibility and can be delayed without affecting the project's completion date.

---

## **2. Free Float (FF)**
### **Definition:**  
Free Float is the amount of time an activity can be delayed **without delaying the start of its immediate successor**.

### **Formula for Free Float:**  
\[
FF = ES_{\text{next activity}} - EF_{\text{current activity}}
\]

### **Key Points:**
- Only applies to **non-critical path activities**.
- It affects only the **next task** in the sequence, not the entire project.

---

## **3. Independent Float (IF)**
### **Definition:**  
Independent Float is the amount of time an activity can be delayed **without affecting the early start of its successor and without delaying the project**.

### **Formula for Independent Float:**  
\[
IF = ES_{\text{next activity}} - LF_{\text{current activity}}
\]

### **Key Points:**
- It is used in **tight scheduling situations**.
- Independent float **only exists if there is a gap between activities**.
- If **IF < 0**, it means there is no independent float.

---

## **4. Interfering Float (IntF)**
### **Definition:**  
Interfering Float is the amount of time an activity can be delayed **without delaying the project’s completion but delaying its successors**.

### **Formula for Interfering Float:**  
\[
IntF = TF - FF
\]

### **Key Points:**
- If **Interfering Float > 0**, delaying the activity **affects its successors but not the project deadline**.
- If **TF = FF**, then **IntF = 0** (i.e., no interference).
- Helps identify **tasks that could cause bottlenecks** in the schedule.

## Question: PERT VS CPM 

### **Comparison of PERT and CPM**  

| Feature | PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) | CPM (Critical Path Method) |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Used for projects with uncertain activity durations (research, R&D, new product development). | Used for projects with well-defined, predictable tasks (construction, manufacturing). |
| **Focus** | Time and uncertainty in task completion. | Time and cost optimization. |
| **Activity Time Estimation** | Uses three-time estimates: Optimistic (O), Most Likely (M), and Pessimistic (P). | Uses a single, deterministic time estimate for each activity. |
| **Formula for Time Calculation** | Expected time \( TE = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6} \) | Uses a fixed duration for each task. |
| **Critical Path** | Identifies the longest path based on probabilistic activity durations. | Identifies the longest path using fixed durations. |
| **Risk Analysis** | Incorporates uncertainty and probability analysis. | Less emphasis on uncertainty, more on cost trade-offs. |
| **Application** | Used in research, software development, and high-risk projects. | Used in construction, production, and industrial projects. |
| **Flexibility** | More flexible due to probabilistic nature. | Less flexible since it assumes fixed task durations. |
| **Cost Consideration** | Primarily focuses on time management, not cost. | Includes time-cost trade-offs to optimize project expenses. |

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Use PERT** when dealing with uncertain or research-based projects where task durations are unpredictable.  
- **Use CPM** when dealing with well-structured projects with known durations and cost considerations.
