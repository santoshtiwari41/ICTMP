- Analyze if the conflict is due to **miscommunication, workload imbalance, unclear roles, or technical disagreements**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A team member **misses deadlines** repeatedly. Instead of assuming negligence, investigating **workload distribution** may reveal **overcommitment**.  

---

### **3. Use Conflict Resolution Techniques**  
Depending on the severity of the conflict, apply appropriate techniques:  

âœ… **Collaborating (Win-Win Approach)** â€“ Encourage both parties to find a mutually beneficial solution.  
âœ… **Compromising (Give & Take)** â€“ Both sides agree to adjust their stance for the project's benefit.

- Use **RACI Matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)** to clarify roles.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A **designer and developer** argue over UI changes. A **defined workflow** ensures the designer provides final assets before development starts.  

---

### **5. Mediate & Facilitate Constructive Discussions**  
- As a neutral PM, facilitate **conflict resolution meetings** to ensure all voices are heard.  
- Encourage a **focus on solutions rather than personal attacks**.  
- Guide discussions to align with **project goals and company values**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** Two senior developers disagree on using **React vs. Angular**. The PM organizes a **technical debate**, and the team votes based on **scalability, project needs, and maintainability**.  

---

### **6. Provide Emotional Intelligence & Team Support**  
- Recognize **stress, burnout, and frustration** in team members.  
- Encourage **work-life balance** to reduce unnecessary tension.  
- Use **team-building activities** to strengthen relationships.
