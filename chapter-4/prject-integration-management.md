## Chapter-4 Project Integration Management


Project Integration Management is one of the ten knowledge areas in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOKÂ® Guide). It involves coordinating all aspects of a project to ensure that processes are properly aligned and that the project meets its objectives. Below is a detailed explanation of **all seven processes** within Project Integration Management:

---

### 1. **Develop Project Charter**
   - **Purpose**: This process formally authorizes the project and gives the project manager the authority to use organizational resources to accomplish project objectives.
   - **Key Inputs**:
     - Business case (justification for the project)
     - Agreements (contracts or agreements with stakeholders)
     - Enterprise Environmental Factors (organizational culture, infrastructure, etc.)
     - Organizational Process Assets (templates, policies, procedures)
   - **Tools & Techniques**:
     - Expert judgment (input from experienced individuals or groups)
     - Data gathering (brainstorming, focus groups, interviews)
     - Interpersonal and team skills (conflict resolution, facilitation)
     - Meetings (to finalize the charter)
   - **Outputs**:
     - **Project Charter**: A formal document that authorizes the project, outlines high-level objectives, and appoints the project manager.
     - Assumptions and constraints are also documented.

### 2. **Develop Project Management Plan**
   - **Purpose**: This process creates a comprehensive project management plan that serves as the roadmap for executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing the project.
