   - **Formal Communication**: Structured, documented, and follows organizational protocols (e.g., contracts, status reports).  
   - **Informal Communication**: Spontaneous and casual discussions (e.g., chats, brainstorming sessions).  

3. **Vertical vs. Horizontal Communication**  
   - **Vertical Communication**: Information flows **upward** (from team to management) or **downward** (from management to team).  
   - **Horizontal Communication**: Information is shared among peers or departments.  

4. **Written vs. Verbal Communication**  
   - **Written Communication**: Emails, reports, documentation, contracts.  
   - **Verbal Communication**: Meetings, phone calls, video conferences.
