## Question 1:**i. If SPI is 0.80 with earned value being 75 .calculate planned value and also state wheather the project is ahead or behind schedule?
## ii.A project is scheduled for time for 15 months with an estimated cost of 700000.After 5 months ,the evaluation is done and identified that 40% of work is accomplished with cost of 450000.calculate cost and schedule variance for the project.



### **i. Calculate Planned Value (PV) and Determine Schedule Status**

Given:  
- **SPI (Schedule Performance Index)** = 0.80  
- **Earned Value (EV)** = 75 

We need to calculate **Planned Value (PV)** and determine whether the project is ahead or behind schedule.

#### **Formula for SPI (Schedule Performance Index):**  
SPI=EV/PV

Where:  
- **SPI** is the Schedule Performance Index.  
- **EV** is Earned Value.  
- **PV** is Planned Value.

#### **Rearranging the formula to solve for PV:**  

PV = EV/SPI



PV = 75/0.80 = 93.750


So, the **Planned Value (PV)** is **$93,750**.

#### **Schedule Status:**
- If **EV > PV**, the project is **ahead of schedule**.
- If **EV < PV**, the project is **behind schedule**.

Since the **EV = $75,000** and **PV = $93,750**, the **project is behind schedule** because **EV < PV**.

---

### **ii. Calculate Cost and Schedule Variance**

Let's calculate the **Cost Variance (CV)** and **Schedule Variance (SV)** using the given information.

### **Given Data:**
- **Total Duration (Planned Time, PT) =** 15 months  
- **Total Budget (Budget at Completion, BAC) =** $700,000  
- **Time Passed =** 5 months  
- **Work Accomplished =** 40%  
- **Actual Cost (AC) =** $450,000  

### **Formulas:**
1. **Earned Value (EV):**  
   EV=Percentage of Work Accomplished×BAC
   𝐸𝑉=0.40×700,000=280,000 EV=0.40×700,000=280,000

2. **Planned Value (PV):**  
   Planned progress at 5 months:  
  Planned Progress= 15/5​ = 1/3=33.33% 𝑃𝑉=0.3333×700,000=233,333.33 

3. **Schedule Variance (SV):**  
   \[
   SV = EV - PV
   \]  
   \[
   SV = 280,000 - 233,333.33 = 46,666.67
   \]  
   **(Positive SV → The project is ahead of schedule)**  

4. **Cost Variance (CV):**  
   \[
   CV = EV - AC
   \]  
   \[
   CV = 280,000 - 450,000 = -170,000
   \]  
   **(Negative CV → The project is over budget)**  

### **Conclusion:**
- **Schedule Variance (SV) =** **+46,666.67** → The project is **ahead of schedule**.  
- **Cost Variance (CV) =** **-170,000** → The project is **over budget**.

## Question 3.Assume we are halfway through a year long project that has a total budget of 100,000.The amount budgeted through this six month mark is $ 55,000.The actual cost through this six month mark is $45,000.With this information calculate CV,SV,CPI,SPI,EAC,ETC.

---

### **Given Data:**
- **Total Project Duration** = 1 year (12 months)
- **Project Midpoint** = 6 months
- **Total Budget (Budget at Completion, BAC)** = $100,000
- **Planned Value (PV) at 6 months** = $55,000
- **Actual Cost (AC) at 6 months** = $45,000

However, we are missing Earned Value (EV). Since we are at the halfway point (6 months into a 12-month project), we assume that the **percentage of work completed** is 50% of the BAC.

\[
EV = \text{Percentage of Work Completed} \times BAC
\]

\[
EV = 0.50 \times 100,000 = 50,000
\]

---

### **Calculations:**

#### **1. Cost Variance (CV)**  
\[
CV = EV - AC
\]
\[
CV = 50,000 - 45,000 = 5,000
\]  
**(Positive CV → Project is under budget)**  

---

#### **2. Schedule Variance (SV)**  
\[
SV = EV - PV
\]
\[
SV = 50,000 - 55,000 = -5,000
\]  
**(Negative SV → Project is behind schedule)**  

---

#### **3. Cost Performance Index (CPI)**  
\[
CPI = \frac{EV}{AC}
\]
\[
CPI = \frac{50,000}{45,000} = 1.11
\]  
**(CPI > 1 → Project is cost-efficient, spending less than planned)**  

---

#### **4. Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**  
\[
SPI = \frac{EV}{PV}
\]
\[
SPI = \frac{50,000}{55,000} = 0.91
\]  
**(SPI < 1 → Project is behind schedule)**  

---

#### **5. Estimate at Completion (EAC)**  
**Using formula:**  
\[
EAC = \frac{BAC}{CPI}
\]
\[
EAC = \frac{100,000}{1.11} = 90,090.09
\]  
**(EAC < BAC → Project is expected to cost less than planned, meaning savings)**  

---

#### **6. Estimate to Complete (ETC)**  
\[
ETC = EAC - AC
\]
\[
ETC = 90,090.09 - 45,000 = 45,090.09
\]  
**(ETC → The remaining estimated cost to complete the project)**

## Question: What is cost Estimation? .What are the different types of estimating techniques used in estimating cost? Explain in brief.


## **Cost Estimation**
Cost estimation is the process of predicting the total cost required to complete a project, task, or product. It helps in budgeting, planning, and decision-making by assessing all direct and indirect costs involved. Cost estimation is crucial for project management, financial forecasting, and resource allocation.

### **Types of Cost Estimation Techniques**
Cost estimation techniques can be broadly categorized into **analogous, parametric, bottom-up, and three-point estimation methods**. Below are the different types of cost estimating techniques explained briefly:

---

### **1. Analogous Estimating (Top-Down Estimation)**
- Uses past project data to estimate the cost of a new project.
- Relies on historical information from similar projects.
- Suitable for early-stage estimations when limited details are available.
- **Example:** If a similar project was completed for $1 million, the new project is estimated to have a similar cost.

**Pros:** Quick, simple, cost-effective.  
**Cons:** Less accurate, depends on historical data.

---

### **2. Parametric Estimating**
- Uses mathematical models and statistical relationships between variables to estimate costs.
- Based on unit costs, productivity rates, or other measurable parameters.
- **Example:** If painting one square foot costs $5, and the total area is 1,000 square feet, the estimated cost is **$5 × 1000 = $5,000**.

**Pros:** More accurate than analogous estimating, scalable for different project sizes.  
**Cons:** Requires reliable data and defined parameters.

---

### **3. Bottom-Up Estimating**
- Breaks down the project into smaller components (Work Breakdown Structure - WBS).
- Estimates cost at the smallest work level and sums up for the total cost.
- **Example:** Estimating labor, materials, and equipment separately and then adding them up.

**Pros:** Highly accurate, detailed, and specific.  
**Cons:** Time-consuming, requires extensive data.

---

### **4. Three-Point Estimating (PERT – Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**
- Uses three cost estimates to account for uncertainties:
  - **Optimistic (O):** Best-case scenario (lowest cost)
  - **Most Likely (M):** Most probable cost
  - **Pessimistic (P):** Worst-case scenario (highest cost)
- The expected cost is calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{E} = \frac{(O + 4M + P)}{6}
  \]
- **Example:** If O = $8,000, M = $10,000, and P = $15,000, then:
  \[
  E = \frac{(8000 + 4(10000) + 15000)}{6} = 10,500
  \]

**Pros:** Reduces risk by considering uncertainty.  
**Cons:** Requires multiple estimates, making it complex.

---

### **5. Expert Judgment**
- Based on expert opinions and industry experience.
- Useful when no historical data is available.
- Often used in combination with other techniques.

**Pros:** Quick and applicable to new projects.  
**Cons:** Subjective and may lead to biased estimations.

---

### **6. Reserve Analysis**
- Adds contingency reserves for unexpected risks.
- Used to manage cost overruns.

**Pros:** Helps in risk management.  
**Cons:** May lead to overestimation.

---

### **7. Vendor Bid Analysis**
- Uses cost estimates from vendors or suppliers for project components.
- Helps in negotiating contracts.

**Pros:** Real-world data from suppliers.  
**Cons:** Cost varies based on market conditions.

---

## Question : Descirbe about Earned value Analysis

## **Earned Value Analysis (EVA)**
Earned Value Analysis (EVA) is a project management technique used to measure project performance and progress in terms of cost and schedule. It integrates scope, cost, and schedule to assess how well a project is performing compared to the initial plan.

EVA helps project managers answer key questions such as:
- **Are we ahead or behind schedule?**
- **Are we over or under budget?**
- **How much work has been completed relative to the plan?**
- **What is the expected total cost at completion?**

---

## **Key Components of Earned Value Analysis**
EVA relies on three fundamental metrics:

### **1. Planned Value (PV)**
- PV represents the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work at a specific point in time.
- Also known as **Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS)**.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  PV = \text{Planned % of work} \times \text{Total Budget (BAC)}
  \]
- **Example:** If a project has a **total budget of $100,000** and is expected to be **50% completed by now**, then:
  \[
  PV = 50\% \times 100,000 = 50,000
  \]

---

### **2. Earned Value (EV)**
- EV is the budgeted amount for the actual work completed at a given point in time.
- Also called **Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP)**.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  EV = \text{Actual % of work completed} \times \text{Total Budget (BAC)}
  \]
- **Example:** If only **40% of the work is completed** in the same project:
  \[
  EV = 40\% \times 100,000 = 40,000
  \]

---

### **3. Actual Cost (AC)**
- AC is the actual amount spent on the work performed so far.
- Also known as **Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP)**.
- This value is directly obtained from financial records.
- **Example:** If the company **has spent $45,000 so far**, then AC = **$45,000**.

---

## **Performance Indicators in EVA**
Using the key metrics (PV, EV, AC), we can derive important performance indicators:

### **1. Cost Variance (CV)**
- CV shows whether the project is over or under budget.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  CV = EV - AC
  \]
- **Interpretation:**
  - **CV > 0 (Positive):** Project is under budget.
  - **CV < 0 (Negative):** Project is over budget.
- **Example:**  
  \[
  CV = 40,000 - 45,000 = -5,000
  \]  
  (The project is **over budget** by $5,000.)

---

### **2. Schedule Variance (SV)**
- SV shows whether the project is ahead or behind schedule.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  SV = EV - PV
  \]
- **Interpretation:**
  - **SV > 0 (Positive):** Project is ahead of schedule.
  - **SV < 0 (Negative):** Project is behind schedule.
- **Example:**  
  \[
  SV = 40,000 - 50,000 = -10,000
  \]  
  (The project is **behind schedule** by $10,000.)

---

### **3. Cost Performance Index (CPI)**
- CPI indicates cost efficiency.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  CPI = \frac{EV}{AC}
  \]
- **Interpretation:**
  - **CPI > 1:** Project is cost-efficient (under budget).
  - **CPI < 1:** Project is over budget.
- **Example:**  
  \[
  CPI = \frac{40,000}{45,000} = 0.89
  \]  
  (Since CPI < 1, the project is **over budget**.)

---

### **4. Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**
- SPI shows how efficiently the project is progressing according to schedule.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  SPI = \frac{EV}{PV}
  \]
- **Interpretation:**
  - **SPI > 1:** Project is ahead of schedule.
  - **SPI < 1:** Project is behind schedule.
- **Example:**  
  \[
  SPI = \frac{40,000}{50,000} = 0.80
  \]  
  (Since SPI < 1, the project is **behind schedule**.)

---

### **5. Estimate at Completion (EAC)**
- EAC predicts the total cost of the project at completion based on current performance.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  EAC = \frac{BAC}{CPI}
  \]
- **Example:**  
  \[
  EAC = \frac{100,000}{0.89} = 112,359.55
  \]  
  (The total project cost is now expected to be **$112,359.55**, exceeding the budget.)

---

### **6. Estimate to Complete (ETC)**
- ETC estimates how much more will be needed to complete the remaining work.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  ETC = EAC - AC
  \]
- **Example:**  
  \[
  ETC = 112,359.55 - 45,000 = 67,359.55
  \]  
  (The project will require **$67,359.55** more to complete.)

## Question:Mention the fundamentals of project cost.How the budget of project is detrmined



### **Fundamentals of Project Cost**  
Project cost includes all expenses required to complete a project successfully. The key components include:  

1. **Direct Costs** – Costs that can be directly attributed to the project, such as labor, materials, equipment, and subcontractors.  
2. **Indirect Costs** – Overhead costs that support the project but are not directly tied to it, like utilities, office space, and administrative expenses.  
3. **Fixed Costs** – Costs that remain constant regardless of project progress, such as rent and salaries of permanent staff.  
4. **Variable Costs** – Costs that fluctuate based on project needs, such as raw materials and hourly labor wages.  
5. **Contingency Costs** – Extra funds allocated to handle unforeseen risks or uncertainties.  
6. **Sunk Costs** – Costs already incurred that cannot be recovered, like research and initial studies.  
7. **Opportunity Costs** – The potential benefits lost when choosing one project over another.  

### **How the Budget of a Project is Determined**  
Project budgeting is a systematic process that involves the following steps:  

1. **Defining Project Scope** – Clearly outlining objectives, deliverables, and tasks.  
2. **Estimating Costs** – Identifying costs for each component using techniques like:  
   - **Bottom-Up Estimation** – Summing up costs from detailed individual tasks.  
   - **Top-Down Estimation** – Allocating a budget based on overall constraints.  
   - **Analogous Estimation** – Using historical data from similar projects.  
   - **Parametric Estimation** – Applying mathematical models for cost estimation.  
3. **Allocating Resources** – Distributing costs for labor, materials, and technology.  
4. **Adding Contingency Reserves** – Including buffers for uncertainties and risks.  
5. **Approving the Budget** – Getting approvals from stakeholders and sponsors.  
6. **Monitoring & Controlling** – Regularly tracking expenses against the budget and making adjustments as needed.

## Question:  Consider a project scheduled to complete within four months with total estimated project cost of 8,00,000 .At the end of 3 months,4,00,000 was spent while work done was of cost 2,00,000 with these information calculate CV,SV,CPI,SPI,EAC,ETC 


We can calculate the required project performance metrics using the Earned Value Management (EVM) formulas.

### **Given Data:**
- **Planned Duration** = 4 months  
- **Total Estimated Cost (BAC - Budget at Completion)** = ₹8,00,000  
- **Time Elapsed** = 3 months  
- **Actual Cost (AC)** = ₹4,00,000  
- **Earned Value (EV) (Work Done)** = ₹2,00,000  
- **Planned Value (PV) (Expected Value by Month 3)**  
  - Since the project is planned for **4 months**, the planned monthly cost is:  
    \[
    PV \text{ (per month)} = \frac{BAC}{4} = \frac{8,00,000}{4} = 2,00,000
    \]  
  - So, for 3 months:  
    \[
    PV = 3 \times 2,00,000 = 6,00,000
    \]

---

### **1. Cost Variance (CV)**
\[
CV = EV - AC
\]
\[
CV = 2,00,000 - 4,00,000 = -2,00,000
\]
**Interpretation**: The project is over budget by ₹2,00,000.

---

### **2. Schedule Variance (SV)**
\[
SV = EV - PV
\]
\[
SV = 2,00,000 - 6,00,000 = -4,00,000
\]
**Interpretation**: The project is behind schedule by ₹4,00,000 worth of work.

---

### **3. Cost Performance Index (CPI)**
\[
CPI = \frac{EV}{AC}
\]
\[
CPI = \frac{2,00,000}{4,00,000} = 0.5
\]
**Interpretation**: For every ₹1 spent, only ₹0.50 worth of work is completed. The project is inefficient in terms of cost.

---

### **4. Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**
\[
SPI = \frac{EV}{PV}
\]
\[
SPI = \frac{2,00,000}{6,00,000} = 0.33
\]
**Interpretation**: The project is progressing at **33% of the planned rate** and is significantly behind schedule.

---

### **5. Estimate at Completion (EAC)**
\[
EAC = \frac{BAC}{CPI}
\]
\[
EAC = \frac{8,00,000}{0.5} = 16,00,000
\]
**Interpretation**: The total estimated project cost will increase to **₹16,00,000** due to inefficiencies.

---

### **6. Estimate to Complete (ETC)**
\[
ETC = EAC - AC
\]
\[
ETC = 16,00,000 - 4,00,000 = 12,00,000
\]
**Interpretation**: ₹12,00,000 more is required to complete the project.

---

### **Summary of Results:**
| Metric | Formula | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Cost Variance (CV)** | EV - AC | **-2,00,000** | Over budget |
| **Schedule Variance (SV)** | EV - PV | **-4,00,000** | Behind schedule |
| **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** | EV / AC | **0.5** | Inefficient cost usage |
| **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** | EV / PV | **0.33** | Slow progress |
| **Estimate at Completion (EAC)** | BAC / CPI | **16,00,000** | Expected total cost |
| **Estimate to Complete (ETC)** | EAC - AC | **12,00,000** | Additional funds required |

This project is in serious trouble, as it is both **over budget and behind schedule**. Immediate corrective actions are needed. Would you like recommendations on how to recover the project?
